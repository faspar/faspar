I am a detail-oriented and analytical thinker with superior consultative 
skills, **specializing in transforming data into meaningful insights to 
achieve complex business objectives**. With over 10 years of experience 
as a managing director, I have honed my analytical and problem-solving 
abilities, extracting valuable insights from diverse data sets in financial, 
market research, and operational analysis. Additionally, my background 
in business consulting has equipped me with expertise in research, 
negotiation, and cost-benefit analysis. Graduating at the top of my class 
in a HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, I have acquired a **strong 
foundation in Python, Data Analysis, Data Modeling, Machine Learning, 
and Data Analytics**. With a focus on delivering data-driven strategies, I 
am well-equipped to drive successful outcomes for organizations.
