I am a meticulous and analytical Python developer with a strong focus on leveraging data to drive valuable insights. Through my recent experience in consultancy roles, I have **successfully collaborated with product and engineering teams** to enhance software application experiences. 

My enthusiasm for data analysis stems from my scientific background, which equips me with the expertise to evaluate, measure, and test data quality and effectiveness. Graduating at the top of my class in the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp has further solidified my proficiency in **Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics.**
